        <p> Hi, I'm a double major student in Computer Science and Ecomonics, who loves asian culture and experincing new things. I adore pets and love to play video games such as Stardew Valley and Mario. I recently started doing photography. Capturing the imperfect moments and editing them into something great brings me joy. I hope to develop my skills professionally and one day display them on a website I created.</p>
        <p> Web Development expands your horizon in the creative field.This will aid in my UI and my problem sovling skills. So far the learning experience as been fun. </p>
